Simple language description:

The processor work with different interpretation modes. On start it is in
top mode. Top mode allows the definition of title, date, author, part, sections
and frames. Whitespaces and newlines are ignored.

To define a title write

title: TITLE-TEXT

TITLE-TEXT is a char sequence which ends with a newline \n

The commands date:, author: work similar. They can be used to define the author
and the presentation date.

The command part: followed by a char sequence (ends with newline) creates an
\part{VALUE} in the output.

The command sec: followed by a char sequence (ends with newline) creates an
\section{VALUE} in the output.

A frame is started with >. For example

> MY-FRAME-TITLE

The must be a whitespace after the > and then the frame title is the following
text until the newline.

Inside a frame another set of commands is valid. In that context structures can
be defined with a line starting with '

'My Structure

which generates to \structure{VALUE}

Images are created with img:[properties]file-reference
